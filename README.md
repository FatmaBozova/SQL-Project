# SQL-Project
Hello,

I attended for data science training. I have completed the sql block training, which is the first stage of the training in the course. At the end of each block, we have project studies. I would like to share my SQL project with you.

I will proceed with the project through questions and answers.

Dataset Link: Brazilian E-Commerce Public Dataset by Olist | Kaggle

Question 1: Create ERD by creating the database from the data set in the given link and add it visually. Geolocation table will not be used in the project.
